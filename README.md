ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tommaso and this is my git. I am currently studying @ 42 School of Rome. In this repository i'll upload all my projects with the occasional commentary on the  theory involved in each one of them.

I am a C/C++ developer, a musician, and i have some limited knowledges about MySql, Unix systems, Arduino, and tools like Photoshop/Premiere. 

I am currently starting the 42RomaLuiss Electronics club, and i am a MakerMovement enthusiast.
I am a Tux to the core, Linux is my Os.

My discord contact is sk3z#4948
